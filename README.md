### Gauss Seidel Iterative Method in Matlab
The Gauss-Seidel method is an iterative technique used in solving systems of linear equations. Using KVL and Ohm's Law, unknown currents of resistive circuits are modeled as matrices to be solved with Gauss-Seidel in MATLAB.

For matrices that are not diagonally dominant, ill-conditioned, or where convergence is otherwise not guaranteed, relaxation factor of less than 1 are used in the script to aid in convergence. In well-conditioned matrices, over-relaxation is used to speed convergence.

Project description, as well as a short report on methodology and conclusions can be found in the included PDFs. Completed in Fall 2022 as a course project for MTE 204 Numerical Methods at the University of Waterloo.
